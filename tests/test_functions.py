    Support for usability study for "concept scheme harmonization" workflow.

    Three tasks, each of which is intended to take a usability-study participant no more than ten minutes to complete.

    The tasks, to be done via web browser (HTML over HTTP) UI:

        1. Create a simple concept scheme, with one top concept and two additional concepts, both of which
            are directly narrower than the top concept. Export this concept scheme to a Turtle file.

        2. Load the helioregion concept scheme, and create a harmonization between it and your simple concept scheme.
            You may add a new top concept to your simple scheme, remove any existing concepts, etc.

        3. Export your harmonization both with and without entailments, as two separate Turtle files.

            and choose the default ground-truth strategy.
            Request a R100 analysis. Does your harmonization improve recall?
